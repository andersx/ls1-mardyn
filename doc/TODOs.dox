/** \page "TODOs and Open Issues"

This page should collect open points, concerning design or (non-)functionality
of the code.

There are plenty of TODOs or FIXMEs in the code, which partly refer to individual
persons. Let's place here things which we could use as a basis for Coders' Day or so.

|| Issue    || Description
|  pm files | pm files define mass for dipoles and quadrupoles, which are not
              supported within Mardyn
|  cutoff radius | a lj cutoff is included in the component definition, but not used
                   (both in the phasespace file and in the component class)
| ASCII-Reader   | Not used - but still necessary??? NO, remove it!
| DomainDecomposition -> AssertDisjunctivity | Faster implementation which requires less memory;
                                               Move it one level up (into the abstract super class?)
| Simulation::prepare_start()   | Why necessary? Could become superflous if loop structure in simulate() changed?
| Class Quaternion              | Remove unnecessary methods which are never called.
| Mardyn.cpp                    | Output if compiled in debug mode
| Simulation.cpp ???            | Compile-Flag or if to disable all file output
| ParticleContainers / Molecule classes | move call to calcFM from Molecule::upd_postF()
                     into ParticleContainer::traversePairs(). Then it corresponds to clearFM(),
                     and the initializing call in Simulation.cpp as well in the ForceCalculationTest
                     is not neccessary.
| Simulation.cpp                | move tickRDF() calls into handler->initialize()?
| Molecule.h/cpp                | make id an "unsigned long long int", only this is guaranteed
                                  to be 64 byte (e.g. on BlueGene, it is not). How about size_t?
| Parallelization / Communication | At the moment, particles are converted to ParticleData Objects, then send as
                                    user defined mpi-datatype (which is a conversion again, which is unnecessary?)
                                    Measure the overhead and fix it?!
| LinkedCells::countParticles() | Move all the count-particles methods or replace them, using getRegion() or the methods off class Component.
| Vectorization | Make CellProcessor selectable (Legacy / Vectorized); How to determine Build-Configuration via Make?
