Two test / example scenarios "avendano-a" and "poiseuille-a"

Conditions:

   * LJTS fluid on a LJTS wall (all in LJ reduced units)
   * Acceleration a = 0.5
   * Density rho = 0.4 (flag -c), slightly larger than critical density
   * The wall consists of three graphene layers (-d 3)
   * Channel height h = 6
   * About N = 512 fluid molecules
   * Temperature T = 1.2, slightly higher than critical temperature
   * Accelerating force applies in 10 % of the volume (-v 0.9)
   * The channel fills 60 % of the volume (-V 0.4)
   * Fluid-wall dispersive interaction xi = 0.2 (flag -3)

avendano-a:
   * Purely diffusive mass transfer (two identical fluid components)

poiseuille-a:
   * Pressure-driven Poiseuille flow
