	 * test the RDF for a system of 2x2x3 particles, for the sequential implementation,
	 * so it's not decomposed into several subdomains.
	 *
	 * First determine the particle pairs with the halo being empty . All particles are
	 * located in a regular cartesian grid with mesh width 1.0, the first
	 * particle being located at (1.0/1.0/1.0).
	 *
	 * As we use a cutoff-radius of 1.8 with 100 bins, this implys that in the grid
	 * occur 3 distances for particle pairs: 1.0, sqrt(2.0), and sqrt(3.0), so that
	 * only particle pairs in bins 55 (count = 20), 78 (count = 22) and 96 (count = 8)
	 * can be counted.
	 *
	 * Then we fill the halo and determine the RDF again. Due to the layout of the
	 * domain, only particles with x3==3.0 are copied into the halo with x3==-0.5,
	 * so for them the only distance to particles within the cutoff is 1.5, corresponding
	 * to bin 83 (count = 4).
