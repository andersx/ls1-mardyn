//! @brief interface for any kind of output class
//! @author Martin Bernreuther, Martin Buchholz, et al. (2009)
//!
//! There are lots of different things that possibly might want
//! to be written out, e.g. thermodynimic values, graphical information, 
//! time measurements, ... \n
//! In many cases, the output happens regularly every time step. To keep
//! the other classes as clear as possible, the output routines (especially
//! extensive routines writing special graphics formats for visualization)
//! shouldn't be placed there. That's why this interface was introduced.
//! For a given output task, this interface has to be implemented. This
//! implementation will be called OutputPlugin in the follwing. 
//! 
//! There are three main methodes
//! - initOutput: will be called once in the beginning
//! - doOutput: will be called each time step
//! - finishOutput: will be called at the end
//! To each of this methods, a pointer to the particle Container, to the domain 
//! decomposition and to the domain will be passed. This should cover most of
//! the data that might be necessary for the output.
//! 
//! Of course, several OutputPlugins will be needed in some cases. So the
//! idea is, that the class which controls the simulation (see Simulation.h)
//! has a list of OutputPlugins. At the beginning of the simulation, 
//! for each element in that list the method initOutput is called. 
//! The same will happen in each time step with the method doOutput and at 
//! the end of the simulation with the method finishOutput.
