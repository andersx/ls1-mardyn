//! @brief Adaptive SubCell Data Structure
//! @author Martin Buchholz
//!
//! To understand the AdaptiveSubCells datastructure, you should first read the documentation
//! on the LinkedCells Datastructure, as AdaptiveSubCells is an enhancement of LinkedCells
//! The difference is that not all cells have the same size but the cell size is adapted to the
//! local density. The adaption only allows to refine once, as more refinements result in to
//! much overhead. So during the initialisation, first a regular cell structure is created
//! (Basically LinkedCells with l=rc, so big coarse cells).
//! Depending on the local density, the cells are refinded once (8 subcells) or remain coarse.

	//! @brief initialize the Adaptive SubCell datastructure
	//!
	//! The constructor sets the following variables:
	//! - _cutoffRadius
	//! - _haloWidthInNumCells[3]
	//! - _cellsPerDimension[3]
	//! - _cellLength[3]
	//! - _haloBoundingBoxMin and _haloBoundingBoxMax
	//!
	//! It resized the _cells vector
	//! It resized _localRho and _metaCellIndex
	//! The corner parameters for the constructor describe the bounding box
	//! of the phasespace which belongs directly to this process, so they correspond
	//! to a bounding box including inner + boundary cells but excluding halo cells. \n
	//! But the corners of this class have to include the halo cells.
	//! @param bBoxMin lower corner of the bounding box of the domain belonging to this container
	//! @param bBoxMax higher corner of the bounding box of the domain belonging to this container
	//! @param cutoffRadius distance for which forces have to be calculated
	//! @param cellsInCutoffRadius describes the width of the coarse cells relative to the cutoffRadius.
	//!        This value should be 1, only then a useful adaption to the particle distribution can
	//!        take place. The actual cell size is usually slightly bigger than the cutoffRadius,
	//!        as the domain has to be divided into a natural number of cells --> round up

	//! \li a loop over the boundary cells first calculates forces with all forward cells and all
	//!     backward cells. Here it has to be checked whether the neighbour cell is halo or not.
	//!     If it is Halo, the force is calculated, if it isn't, the force is not calculated,
	//!     because the same pair of cells has already been processed in one of the other loops.

	//! @brief Initialze index vectors and subCells.
	//!
	//! Fill the vector with the indices of the inner and boundary subCells.
	//! Assign each subCell it's region (halo, boundary, inner).
	void initializeSubCells();

	//! @brief Calculate SubCell neighbour indices.
	//!
	//! In contrast to the LinkedCell datastructure, the index offsets to get to
	//! neighbouring cells are different for all cells. So for each cell (coarse or fine),
	//! a vector of index offets has to be calculated. This is done by first
	//! looping over all cells and then for each cell looping over all possible neighbour
	//! cells and storing those in the vector which have a minimal distance less than
	//! the cutoff radius. As an example, let's assume we want to calculate the index
	//! offset between cell A and cell B. There are basically four different cases:
	//! - Cell A fine and Cell B fine
	//! - Cell A fine and Cell B coarse
	//! - Cell A coarse and Cell B fine
	//! - Cell A coarse and Cell B coarse
	//! In each of those cases, the distance is calculated and where required the corresponding
	//! index offset (offset in the vector _subCells) is stored in _forwardNeighbourSubOffsets
	//! of _backwardNeighbourSubOffsets;
	void calculateSubNeighbourIndices();

	//! This method determines for a given Molecule the corresponding coarse cell
	//! and returns the index of that cell in the cell vector. \n
	//! If the molecule is not inside the bounding box, an error is printed
	unsigned long getCellIndexOfMolecule(Molecule* molecule);

	//! @brief Get the index in the subCell vector to which this Molecule belong
	//!
	//! each spacial position within the bounding box of the adaptive linked cells
	//! belongs unambiguously to one subCell. \n
	//! This method determines for a given Molecule the corresponding subCell
	//! and returns the index of that subCell in the subCell vector. \n
	//! If the molecule is not inside the bounding box, an error is printed
	unsigned long getSubCellIndexOfMolecule(Molecule* molecule);

	//! @brief given the 3D index of a subCell, return the index in the subCell vector.
	//!
	//! A cell can be identified by a 3D index. \n
	//! This method determines for a given 3D index the corresponding subCell
	//! and returns the index of that subCell in the subCell vector. \n
	//! Attention: The method can't(!!) be used to get the offset between two cells in the cell
	//! vector when called with the 3D cell index offets (e.g. x: one cell to the left,
	//! y: two cells back, z: one cell up,...). The offsets can differ from subCell to subCell, because both the number and the position of the Cells that are containing subCells can differ.
	unsigned long subCellIndexOf3DIndex(int xIndex, int yIndex, int zIndex);

	//! @brief calculates the metaCellIndex for each coarse Cell and store it in _metaCellIndex
	//!
	//! Each coarse cell (or "meta" cell if the cell is refined) has also an index in
	//! the vector _subCells, which contains coarse and fine cells. metaCellOffset is
	//! the index offset of two coarse of "meta" cellsin the vector _subCells
	void calculateMetaCellIndex();

	//! @brief calculates the density for each coarse Cell separately
	//! @todo: currently, not the density but the number of particles
	//!        is calculated. To change that (or even if it is not changed),

	//! e.g. after the integrator has changed the positions of particles.
	//! If this happens, no method must be able to access the particles via
	//! the cells. Therefore, whenever a piece of code causes the cells to
	//! become possibly invalid, _cellsValid has to been set to false. Methods
	//! accessing cells have to check whether _cellsValid is true (and e.g.
	//! abort the program if not). After the cells are updated, _cellsValid
