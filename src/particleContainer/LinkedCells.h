//! @brief Linked Cell Data Structure
//! @author Martin Buchholz
//!
//! Without any specialized data structure, it needs O(N*N) - where N is
//! the number of particles - time to find all neighbouring pairs of particles.
//! The linked cell data structure is a datastructure which allows to find all
//! neighbouring pairs of particles (neighbouring means particles pairs
//! which have less than a certain distance) in O(N) time.
//! The following picture shows a domain with some particles in it. The blue
//! circle shows the neighbouring area of the red particle
//! \image particles.jpg
//! The problem is that all particles have to be examined to find those within the circle
//! With the linked cell data structure, the domain is divided into cells (using a regular grid).
//! All particles are placed in those cells.
//! For a given cell, neighbouring cells can easily be calculated, so for a given particle,
//! only the particles from neighbouring cells have to be examined. The following
//! picture illustrates this
//! \image particles_with_lc.jpg
//!
//! The spacial domain covered by the linked cells is larger then
//! the bounding box of the domain. This halo region surrounding
//! the phasespace is used for (periodic) boundary conditions
//! and has to be at least as wide as the cutoff radius. \n
//! In total, there are three different cell types:
//! - halo
//! - boundary
//! - inner

	//! The constructor sets the following variables:
	//! - _cutoffRadius

	//! - _tersoffCutoffRadius
	//! - _haloWidthInNumCells[3]
	//! - _cellsPerDimension[3]
	//! - _cellLength[3]

	//!
	//! It resized the cell vector and marks the cells as inner/halo \n
	//! It fills the array innerCellIndices \n
	//! It fills the array with forward and backward neighbour indices \n
	//! The corner parameters for the constructor describe the bounding box
	//! of the phasespace which belongs directly to this process, so they correspond
	//! to a bounding box including inner + boundary cells but excluding halo cells. \n
	//! But the corners of this class have to include the halo cells.
	//! @param bBoxMin lower corner of the bounding box of the domain belonging to this container
	//! @param bBoxMax higher corner of the bounding box of the domain belonging to this container
	//! @param cutoffRadius distance for which forces have to be calculated
	//! @param LJCutoffRadius distance for which lennard jones forces have to be calculated
	//! @param tersoffCutoffRadius distance for which tersoff forces have to be calculated
	//! @param cellsInCutoffRadius describes the width of cells relative to the cutoffRadius: \n
	//!        equal (or larger) to the cutoffRadius divided by the length of a cell
	//!        as for the number of cells in each dimension only natural numbers are allowed,
	//!        it can happen that it is not possible to set celllength = cutoffRadius / cellsInCutoffRadius.
	//!        In that case, the celllength is chosen to be the next larger value so that the sum of
	//!        the cell lengths in one dimension equals the length of the phasespace
	//!        Example: phasespacelength=100, cellsInCutoffRadius=2, CutoffRadius=3 \n
	//!        ==> celllength should be: cutoffRadius/cellsInCutoffRadius = 3/2 = 1.5 \n
	//!        ==> cellsPerDimension = phasespacelength/celllength = 100/1.5 = 66.67 cells \n
	//!        ==> cells have to be larger: cellsPerDimension = phasespacelength/celllength = 100/celllength = 66 cells \n
	//!        ==> celllength = 100/66 = 1.5152

	//! @brief Calculate neighbour indices.
	//!
	//! This method is executed once for the molecule container and not for
	//! each cell. E.g. the index (in the cell vector) of the right neighbour of a cell
	//! always equals the index of the cell minus one. This method calculates two vectors
	//! of index offsets, one for positive offsets (forward neighbours) and one for negative
	//! offsets (backward neighbours). So given a specific cell, the neighbours can be retrieved
	//! by adding to the index of the cell the offsets in the two vectors.
	//!
	//! The method works as follows: \n
	//! The loop runs over all potential neighbour cells (bounding box which contains
	//! the cell itself, and in each dimension on the lower and on the higher side as
	//! many cells as the width of the halo strip. E.g. if the haloWidth is 2, a box
	//! of 5x5x5 cell is considered as potential neighbours
	//! for each of those cells, the minimal possible distance between that cell
	//! and the central cell is calculated (sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)). If that distance
	//! is larger than the cutoff radius, the cell can be neglected.
	//! The distance in one dimension is the width of a cell multiplied with the number
	//! of cells between the two cells (this is received by substracting one of the difference).
