//! @brief This Interface is used to get access to particles and pairs of particles
//! @author Martin Buchholz
//!
//! A particleContainer is used to store Particles with a short-range potential
//! in a way that the access to pairs of neighbouring particles is efficient.
//! Neighbouring particles are particles which have a distance shorter than
//! a given cutoff radius.
//! A common task when using a PariticleContainer is to do something for all
//! particles. This can be done using the methods begin, next and end, e.g.:
//! \code
//! ParticleContainer* partContPtr;
//! Molecule* partPtr;
//! for(partPtr = partContPtr->begin(); partPtr != partContPtr->end(); partPtr = partContPtr->next()){
//!   partPtr->doSomething();
//! }
//! \endcode
//!
//!
//! Particles stored in this container can either belong to the local process
//! or they can be duplicates (from neighbouring processes or periodic boundary).
//! As the simulated regions are often cuboids, a bounding box is defined through
//! two opposing corners (_boundingBoxMin[3] and _boundingBoxMax[3]).
//! Particles inside this bounding box belong to this process, those outside don't.
//! An exception to this is when particles are moved in a time step. It has to be
//! ensured that particles which leave the bounding box are properly handled.
//!
//! For non-cuboid regions, the bounding box still has to be defined as it gives
//! an approximation for the region that is covered by the ParticleContainer.
//!
//! This interface doesn't implement the datastructure, it just tells which
//! methods a class implementing this kind of datastructure has to provide to
//! be used by the framework. Such a class should
//! be implemented as a subclass of this class.

	//! For some implementations of the interface ParticleContainer, the place
	//! where particles are stored might e.g. depend on the spacial position of the

	//! two different pairs, but they both times connect the same particles.
	//! For a pair which occurs twice, it has to be made sure, that one gets the status "original pair"
	//! and the other one "duplicated pair".
