/**
 * A TestWithSimulationSetup has the ability to setup every thing needed for a
 * simulation, that is mainly
 *
 * - rank
 * - domain
 * - domainDecomposition
 * - particleContainer
 *
 * With those members set up it should be possible to test all the single aspects
 * of a molecular dynamics simulation.
 *
 * Those fiels are setup from scratch before the execution of every test method, so
 * every test has a clean test bed.
 * The member objects are automatically destroyed after a test method has been executed.
 *
 * @note Testing the sequential algorithm indepentend of the number of MPI-processes
 *       Mardyn has been started with, should be possible if you replace the
 *       domainDecomposition with a dummyDomainDecomposition before the particleContainer
 *       is initialized.
 *
 * @note The components (i.e. molecule types) specified in the input file used
 *       in initializeFromFile() can be accessed via _domain->getComponents();
