/** @brief Controls the simulation process
 *  @author Martin Bernreuther <bernreuther@hlrs.de> et al. (2010)
 *
 * Some of the simulation parameters are provided in a config file.
 * The order of the parameters in the config file is important.
 * Thats's because e.g. the datastructure can only be built after the
 * phasespace has been read.
 *
 * The config file usually has the file ending ".cfg" and
 * starts with a line containing the token "mardynconfig"
 * followed by the following parameters, among others
 * (possibly mixed with comment lines starting with "#"):
 * - timestepLength: Uses by the Iterator to calculate new velocities and positions
 * - cutoffRadius: Determines the maximum distance for which the force between two
 *                   molecules still has to be calculated
 * - phaseSpaceFile: Full path to the XDR file containing the phase space
 * - parallelization: Parallelisation scheme to be used
 *                    - DomainDecomposition: standard spacial domain decomposition into
 *                                           cuboid regions of equal size
 * - datastructure: Datastructure to be used (e.g. Linked Cells) followed by
 *                    the parameters for the datastructures
 *                  The datastructure LinkedCells needs one additional parameter,
 *                  which is the number of cells in the cutoff radius (equals to the
 *                  cutoff radius divided by the cell length).
 *
 * Example for a config file:
 *
 * \code{.txt}
 *  mardynconfig
 *  timestepLength 0.00005
 *  cutoffRadius 3.0
 *  phaseSpaceFile OldStype phasespace.xdr
 *  # datastructure followed by the parameters for the datastructure
 *  # for LinkedCells, the cellsInCutoffRadius has to be provided
 *  datastructure LinkedCells 1
 *  parallelization DomainDecomposition

	 * The present version of Mardyn provides the option of
	 * equilibrating the system at an increased temperature. This has,
	 * of course, the advantage that the equilibration is accelerated.
	 * In a special case that is of particular interest to a relevant
	 * subset of the developers, namely MD simulation of nucleation,
	 * it also reduces the amount of clusters formed during
	 * equilibration. Then, the actual nucleation process can be
	 * investigated for the equilibrated system.
	 *
	 * Equilibration at an increased temperature is nothing new, in
	 * principle it could be considered a variant of simulated
	 * annealing. For the purpose of accelerating the relaxation,
	 * starting from an unrealistic initial state, it was e.g.
	 * proposed in the thesis of M. Kreitmeir.
	 *
	 * The key parameter to regulating the equilibration is
	 * this->_initCanonical. The system is gradually heated and cooled
	 * again, and from this->_initCanonical on the temperature is
	 * constant (i.e. this method returns 1.0).
