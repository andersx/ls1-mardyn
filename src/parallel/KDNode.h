//! @brief represents a node in the decomposition tree when using KDDecomposition
//! @author Martin Buchholz, Wolfgang Eckhardt
//! 
//! The KDDecomposition decomposes the domain by recursively splitting the domain
//! into smaller parts. This class is used to represent this decomposition.
//! The root node of the decomposition covers the whole domain, in the first
//! splitting step, this domain is divided into two parts, where each part
//! then has to be divided into several smaller parts. How many parts/regions there
//! depends on the number of processes, each process will get one region.
//! So the KNNode also has to store how many process "share" the current region
//! The leaf nodes of the tree represent the region of the single processes.
//! The regions (the size of the regions) is not stored in some floating-point length unit
//! but in cells. So it is assumed that the domain is discretised with cells and
//! the decomposition is based on distributing those cells (blocks of cells) to the
//! processes
