//! @brief Update velocities and positions.
//! @author Martin Buchholz, Martin Bernreuther, et al.
//!
//! The basic idea of the integrator is, that it calculates from
//! given values at one timestep the corresponding values in the next timestep.
//! A PRECONDITION for each integrator is, that all values that the integrator
//! reads before it writes them have to be available at the same point in
//! time (usually t=0). E.g. positions and velocities are always available
//! at the same starting time as they are read from the input file, but
//! the forces don't stand in the input file, so they have to be calculated
//! for t=0 before the integrator starts working.
//!
//! The idea of this interface is that different integrators can be used,
//! but the user of the main application shouldn't have to care which
//! integrator is used. This of course means, that there can't be a
//! method called "second_velocity_half_step_of_leapfrog_integrator".
//! For different integrators, different steps at different steps of
//! the program are needed. So it isn't feasible to have methods which
//! performs a certain step of an integrator. The "User" even might not know,
//! which information the integrator needs to calculate a certain value.
//! So the idea is, the the user (surrounding method) informs the integrator
//! whenever some new information (e.g. new Forces on the molecules) is
//! available. The integrator should then know what can be done with
//! this new information (e.g. calculate new accelaration)

	//! Basically, the only point where an integrator has to interrupt it's work is when

	//! the simulation program usually wants to do something (output) between two time steps
	//! (this has to be done as only then all values (x, v,...) are avaiable for the same point in time).
	//! So the integrator interrupts it's work at the end of one time step and resumes work
	//! with the call of this method.
